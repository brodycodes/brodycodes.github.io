                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Akeso is a platform for families to prevent and manage Type 2 Diabetes together. The project was placed as
                    a design challenge finalist for the Berkeley-Haas Healthcare Conference 2015. We've recently received
                    news that our work will be shared with the CDC.</p>
                <p>As a designer for the team, my responsibilities included visual design, UX/UI design, and branding. I also
                    collaborated with other team members from different disciplines on ideation, user research, market research,
                    ethnographic studies, competitor analysis, and business model. This case study will focus mostly on the
                    design process.</p>

                <h3>The problem</h3>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="small-12 medium-7 columns">
                        <p>Type 2 Diabetes is a lifestyle disease that is difficult to prevent and manage without having a supportive
                            system in place. Current solutions are lacking in providing a comprehensive platform for both
                            prevention and management of the disease. Most importantly, these solutions are not empowering
                            the family unit as a whole: Diabetes is not an individual, isolated disease. Additionally, the
                            national cost for diabetes management is astronomical. </p>

                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3>Our Solution</h3>
                <p>We created a two-part solution, a companion app and a subscription box, to deliver the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Family participation</li>
                    <li>Professional support</li>
                    <li>Tailored information</li>
                    <li>Convenient management tools</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>After interviewing patients with diabetes and healthcare professionals with expertise in treating this chronic
                    disease, we found a common theme of "family" present in all treatment and management strategies. This
                    finding is reflected throughout our product. <img src="img/akeso/user_research.png" /></p>
                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3>Visual Branding</h3>
                <p>In creating a family-oriented digital health solution, I wanted to expand upon the usual "medical blue" and
                    "medical green", which convey professionalism and confidence, to include a warmer color for family-friendliness.
                    The color palette was created using <a href="http://coolors.co/app/2ac0db-d05475-13c4a3-4c6085-e8e8e8"
                    target="_blank">Coolors.co</a>. The selected typography is also less institutional and more welcoming.
                    Here is the style guide I established for the team to use in pitch deck and app design.</p>

                            <br>

                        <p>The logo is a stylized origami hummingbird, a nod to the popular paper crane, simple and playful.
                            Hummingbirds are known for their sugar-based nectar diets, but their feeding practices and high
                            activity levels represent the lifestyle changes we want to introduce. These birds have also been
                            seen to <a href="http://www.ecology.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/008_9_yost_nesting_annas_hu.jpg"

                <h3>High-fidelity design mocks</h3>
                <p>Since we were on a tight timeline to create something presentable and polished for the pitch competition,
                    I decided to focus on creating some sample screens, instead of going through low-fidelity design steps.
                    This was a challenge in itselfâ€”producing seemingly final designs without proper wireframes and iterations.</p>
                <p> The message we wanted to present through the app was the overarching theme of "family" and accessibility
                    to a healthcare professional that could fit in 1 minute of presentation. Here are the screens I created
                    to tell this narrative. We decided to use characters from a well-known family: <em>The Incredibles.</em></p>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <p><img src="img/akeso/akeso_started.png" alt="" />
                        <br> The getting started screen walks a user through adding her family members</p>
                    <p><img src="img/akeso/akeso_dashboard.png" alt="" />
                        <br> An overview dashboard showing progress and vitals of family members</p>
                    <p><img src="img/akeso/akeso_np.png" alt="" />
                        <br> A health coach can be reached via messaging or a video call</p>
                </div>
                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>I was able to present these screens as a sample patient journey in the alloted 1 minute (out of 5 minutes
                    total for the pitch presentation). These screens allowed us to show, at a high level, how a family can
                    participate and track everyone's progress, and how a user can conveniently reach a health coach.</p>
